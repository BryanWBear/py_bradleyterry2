    "The design matrix is given as follows. If there are $N$ players, then the design matrix $M$ has shape ${N \\choose 2} \\times N$. First, we order the combinations lexicographically, that is: $$\\{1,2\\}, \\{1,3\\}, \\dots, \\{N-1, N\\}$$ If $C_i = \\{a, b\\}$, then $M[i][a] = 1$ and $M[i][b] = -1$. All other entries in the row are set to 0. Afterwards, we delete the first column so that $M$ now has shape ${N \\choose 2} - 1 \\times N$. This ensures that the coefficient of the first player $\\beta_1$ is 0. The other common constraint is $\\sum \\beta_i = 1$. The reason why a constraint is needed is because the optimization problem is scale invariant, so we need to pick some reference. \n",
